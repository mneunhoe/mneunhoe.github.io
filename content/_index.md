Welcome! I'm a researcher working at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and social science, with a focus on privacy-preserving AI and synthetic data generation.

I currently work as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Institute for Employment Research (IAB)](https://iab.de/mitarbeiter/neunhoeffer-marcel/) and [LMU Munich](https://www.soda.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html), collaborating with the US Census Bureau and German Federal Statistical Office on privacy-preserving methods for sensitive data.

My work emphasizes rigorous evaluation over hype - demonstrating both the potential and limitations of modern machine learning methods for social science applications.
